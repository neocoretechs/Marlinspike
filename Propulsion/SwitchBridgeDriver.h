/* 
* SwitchBridgeDriver.h
* A motor driver that uses straight GPIO switching rather than PWM, for an on/off drive motor setup.
*
* Structure:
* 1) Top level, a master list of pins in the digitals array. Slots to which physical pins are assigned.
* these are pdigitals here, which hold pointers to these top level array.
* 2) In each class and subclass, a sublist of pins. Multidimensional array which holds the index to the top level pins.
* these are indexed by channel. motorDrive here.
* Since the M1 and M2 inputs are split, we add an additional motorDriveB multidimensional array for the second input.
* NOTE: The pin assignment for the IO pins is arranged in the index array one after the other, so the assignment for M1 is at pindex
* and the assignment for M2 is at pindex+1. This does NOT mean the pins have to be next to each other, its just that the indexes in
* the arrays are arranged one after the other for convenience.
* 3) A GPIO pin list indexed by channel. The level value is either a + or - value for on or off.
* 4) Optionally, a duration. The duration represents a maximum interval before the GPIO pin
* is automatically shut down. In this case, the hall effect interrupts that are serviced by an interrupt handler that detect wheel rotation.
* the top level abstract class AbstractMotorControl contains these values.
